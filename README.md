Flipper zero weapon .fap
1. Physical Access Bypass (RFID)
Scenario: You walk up to a door that uses HID 125kHz badges.

Action:
You scan a coworker’s badge once using the LF Reader.
BlackBat saves the UID and generates a .bin clone format.
Then you use the T5577 UID Switcher to write it to a blank key fob.
Tap the clone to the door: ✅ access granted.

🔮 Bonus: In the bonus folder, em4100_variants.txt can be used to cycle through known UIDs — helpful for brute-force attempts against unprotected readers.

2. Transit or University Card Clone
Scenario: Your student card or metro pass uses MIFARE Classic.

Action:
You scan it with MIFARE Full Dump.
It pulls all sector data and tries a built-in key dictionary brute on protected blocks.
You then load the sector_edit_example.txt to modify balance or replace sector data.
Finally, emulate it using the NFC Type A/B Emulation Tool.

🔮 Bonus: sector_edit_example.txt shows how edited bits look versus the original, so you can verify that value blocks were modified without triggering tamper bits.

3. Contactless Payment Tap Interceptor
Scenario: You want to understand how Google Pay behaves in NFC range.

Action:
Enable EMV Passive Logger mode.
Hover your Flipper nearby (within 5 cm) while you tap a card on a payment reader.

You capture a timestamped APDU exchange log, which shows:

Application ID (AID)

Terminal verification steps

Cryptogram challenge

Tap strength response log (based on RF power from reader)

🔮 Bonus: These logs are useful for replay simulation or export into APDU analysis tools like SmartcardHacker or WinSCard.

4. Tesla Key Card Clone (Theoretical)
Scenario: You’re testing a new Tesla NFC key.

Action:
Use NFC Type A/B scan to grab the Tesla card’s UID and dynamic data response.
Cross-check against future_card_mock.json in the bonus files — which contains mock Tesla tag structure for analysis.

If the UID matches known patterns, you can spoof the UID and attempt a keyless unlock replay using dynamic emulation.

🔮 Bonus: If it fails, it’s logged with time/diff/UID mismatch for debugging.

5. Brute Testing Commercial NFC
Scenario: Testing a vending machine that uses NTAG213/215 for loyalty tracking.

Action:
Run the NFC Type A Emulation, load ntag213_clone.nfc and spoof the sector data.
Modify values to fake points or simulate transaction data.
You compare what happens before and after (does it decrement the value?).

🔮 Bonus: Logs export to web GUI JSON for external visualization on a computer or phone.

👁️ SIGNAL STRENGTH VISUALIZER
This shows the tap accuracy in real time, similar to how RF signal strength meters work.

You can test:

Coil alignment

Read/write reliability

NFC field overlap for EMV replay zones

The visualizer outputs to signal_visual_log.txt, showing tap intensity and success/failure.
